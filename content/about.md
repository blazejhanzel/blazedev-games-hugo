**Hey!** I’m Błażej, 26 y.o. indie game dev from Poland 🇵🇱  
I made *Astro Strike – Space Shooter* 👾 and a Unity tool called *Blaze Builder – Easy Multiplatform Build* 🎮  
I mess around with all kinds of gamedev projects 💻 and share them on YouTube 🎬

I got into making games when I was 13, went to my first workshop at 15, built a bunch of random projects that never saw the light of day, and eventually dropped **my first released game** 🥳  

These days I’m documenting my journey on **Bluesky** and **YouTube** – with devlogs, tips, and tutorials all about game dev 🚀
